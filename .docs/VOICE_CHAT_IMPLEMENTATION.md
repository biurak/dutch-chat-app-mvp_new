## üéØ How to Use

### Testing Voice Features
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test` to test voice functionality
2. Check browser support indicators
3. Test voice recording by clicking "Start Recording"
4. Test text-to-speech with Dutch and English

### Using Voice Chat in Conversations
1. Navigate to any topic (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/ordering-cafe`)
2. Click the microphone button to start voice recording
3. Speak in Dutch - the transcript will appear in the input field
4. Click speaker buttons on messages to hear Dutch or English audio
5. Recording indicator shows when voice input is active

## üõ† Technical Implementation Details

### Voice Recording Flow
1. User clicks microphone button
2. `handleVoiceInput()` starts/stops recording
3. Speech Recognition API transcribes audio
4. Transcript automatically populates input field
5. User can send message normally

### Text-to-Speech Flow
1. User clicks speaker button on any message
2. `handlePlayAudio()` called with text and language
3. Speech Synthesis API speaks the text
4. Visual feedback shows playing state
5. Can stop/start audio playback

### Error Handling
- Microphone permission denied
- Browser compatibility issues
- Network errors during recognition
- Audio playback failures
- User-friendly error messages displayed

## üåê Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium (full support)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge (full support)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Firefox (limited Speech Recognition support)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Safari (limited Speech Recognition support)

### Recommended Setup
- Use Chrome or Edge for best experience
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Use HTTPS in production (required for Speech Recognition)

## üé® UI Components Added

### Voice Input
- Microphone button in input section
- Red pulsing animation when recording
- Recording indicator overlay
- Error message display

### Voice Output
- Speaker buttons for each message
- Dutch and English audio options
- Play/Stop visual indicators
- Volume icons (Volume2/VolumeX)

## üîß Configuration Options

### Voice Recording Settings
```typescript
const voiceRecording = useVoiceRecording({
  language: 'nl-NL',        // Dutch language
  continuous: false,        // Single recognition session
  interimResults: true      // Show partial results
});
```

### Text-to-Speech Settings
```typescript
const textToSpeech = useTextToSpeech({
  rate: 1,     // Speech rate (0.1-10)
  pitch: 1,    // Voice pitch (0-2)
  volume: 1    // Audio volume (0-1)
});
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Speech Recognition
- Requires HTTPS in production
- Limited browser support (Chrome/Edge recommended)
- Accuracy depends on microphone quality and background noise
- May not work on all mobile devices

### Text-to-Speech
- Voice availability varies by operating system
- Some voices may not support Dutch language
- Playback quality varies by system

### Workarounds Implemented
- Browser compatibility checking
- Graceful fallbacks when features unavailable
- Clear error messages for users
- Non-blocking implementation (voice features don't break chat)

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Voice Settings Panel**: Allow users to adjust speech rate, pitch, volume
2. **Voice Training**: Improve recognition accuracy for individual users
3. **Offline Support**: Add offline voice recognition capabilities
4. **More Languages**: Support additional languages beyond Dutch/English
5. **Voice Commands**: Add voice commands for app navigation
6. **Audio Visualization**: Add waveform visualization during recording

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Voice Caching**: Cache synthesized audio for repeated phrases
2. **Lazy Loading**: Load voice features only when needed
3. **Error Recovery**: Better error recovery and retry mechanisms

## üì± Mobile Considerations

### Current Status
- Basic functionality works on mobile browsers
- Touch interactions properly implemented
- Responsive design maintained

### Mobile-Specific Issues
- iOS Safari has limited Speech Recognition support
- Android Chrome works well
- Microphone permissions may behave differently

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Data Handling
- Voice data processed locally by browser APIs
- No audio data sent to external servers
- Transcripts only stored temporarily in component state
- User consent required for microphone access

### Production Considerations
- HTTPS required for Speech Recognition API
- Microphone permissions must be explicitly granted
- Consider adding privacy policy mentions for voice features
