# Translation API Optimizations - Emergency Fix

## Critical Issue Resolved

The application was making excessive API calls to OpenAI through the `/api/translate` endpoint, causing rate limits to be exceeded. Even after initial optimizations, the code was still making multiple API calls in loops.

## Emergency Measures Implemented

### 1. Temporary Disable of Word Extraction
**File**: `app/[topic]/chat-client.tsx`

**Action**: Completely commented out the `processConversationForNewWords` call
**Reason**: Immediate stopgap to prevent further API abuse while optimizations are refined

### 2. Global Rate Limiting
**File**: `lib/text-utils.ts`

**Added**:
- Global API call counter with 10 calls per minute limit
- Automatic translation disabling when limit is reached
- Session-based API call tracking

```typescript
const GLOBAL_API_LIMIT = 10; // Max 10 API calls per minute
let isTranslationDisabled = false;
```

### 3. Per-Extraction Limits
**File**: `lib/text-utils.ts`

**Added**:
- Maximum 3 API calls per word extraction session
- Maximum 2 words per sentence (reduced from 5)
- Process only 1 message at a time (reduced from 2)

### 4. Emergency Controls
**File**: `lib/text-utils.ts`

**Added functions**:
- `disableTranslations()` - Manual disable
- `enableTranslations()` - Manual enable  
- `getTranslationStatus()` - Monitor status

## Immediate Impact

- **100% reduction** in translation API calls (temporarily disabled)
- **Eliminated** rate limit errors
- **Preserved** core chat functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Verify API usage has stopped
2. **Test**: Gradually re-enable with stricter limits
3. **Implement**: Bulk translation API if needed
4. **Consider**: Alternative approaches (client-side dictionary, pre-computed words)

## How to Re-enable (When Ready)

1. Uncomment the code in `chat-client.tsx`
2. Or call `enableTranslations()` programmatically
3. Monitor API usage carefully

## Alternative Solutions to Consider

1. **Pre-computed word lists** per topic
2. **Client-side Dutch dictionary** 
3. **Bulk translation API** (translate multiple words in one call)
4. **User-driven translation** (only translate on user request)
5. **Static word database** instead of AI translation
