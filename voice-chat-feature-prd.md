# Feature PRD: Voice Chat for Dutch Learning App

## Document Information
- **Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- **Feature**: Voice Chat Capabilities
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: June 27, 2025
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of voice chat capabilities for the Dutch Chat App MVP, enabling users to practice Dutch through speech-to-text input and text-to-speech output. This feature will enhance the language learning experience by allowing pronunciation practice and auditory learning.

## Product Overview

### Current State
The Dutch Chat App MVP currently provides:
- Text-based chat interface with AI tutor
- Grammar correction and translation features
- Topic-based conversations (café ordering, doctor visits, grocery shopping)
- Suggestion-based quick responses
- Real-time message streaming
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for AI responses

### Problem Statement
Language learners need to practice:
- **Speaking skills**: Pronunciation and verbal fluency
- **Listening skills**: Understanding spoken Dutch
- **Hands-free interaction**: Mobile usage while walking, commuting, etc.
- **Accessibility**: Support for users with typing difficulties

Current text-only interface limits these essential aspects of language learning.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Enable Voice Input**: Users can speak Dutch messages instead of typing
2. **Enable Voice Output**: Users can listen to AI responses and their own messages
3. **Maintain Quality**: Voice features work with existing grammar correction and translation
4. **Improve Accessibility**: Support users with different interaction preferences

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 40% of users try voice input within first week
- **Engagement**: 25% increase in message frequency when voice is used
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ speech recognition accuracy for Dutch
- **Retention**: Voice users have 20% higher session duration

## Technical Requirements

### Speech-to-Text Implementation

#### Option 1: Web Speech API (Recommended for MVP)
```typescript
interface SpeechRecognitionConfig {
  language: 'nl-NL' | 'en-US';
  continuous: boolean;
  interimResults: boolean;
}
```

**Pros:**
- Native browser support
- No additional API costs
- Low latency
- Works offline (some browsers)

**Cons:**
- Browser compatibility limitations
- Less accurate than cloud services
- Limited customization

#### Option 2: Cloud Speech API (Future Enhancement)
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
- Azure Speech Services
- OpenAI Whisper API

### Text-to-Speech Implementation

#### Option 1: Web Speech Synthesis API (Recommended for MVP)
```typescript
interface TTSConfig {
  voice: SpeechSynthesisVoice;
  rate: number; // 0.1 to 10
  pitch: number; // 0 to 2
  volume: number; // 0 to 1
}
```

#### Option 2: Cloud TTS (Future Enhancement)
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
- Azure Cognitive Services
- ElevenLabs for natural voices

### Technical Architecture

#### New State Management
```typescript
// Add to ChatClient component
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [audioPlaying, setAudioPlaying] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [speechSettings, setSpeechSettings] = useState({
  rate: 1,
  voice: null as SpeechSynthesisVoice | null,
  autoPlay: false
});
```

#### New Hooks
- `useVoiceRecording()`: Handle speech-to-text
- `useTextToSpeech()`: Handle text-to-speech
- `useVoiceSettings()`: Manage user preferences

#### API Endpoints
- Existing `/api/correct` works for voice input
- Existing `/api/chat/[topic]` works for voice messages
- New `/api/voice/settings` for user preferences (future)

### UI/UX Requirements

#### Voice Input Controls
- **Recording Button**: Replace current mic button with functional version
- **Recording Indicator**: Visual waveform or pulsing animation
- **Recording Timer**: Show duration during recording
- **Transcription Display**: Show text as it's being recognized
- **Edit Capability**: Allow editing transcribed text before sending

#### Voice Output Controls
- **Speaker Icons**: Add to each message bubble
- **Play/Pause/Stop**: Standard audio controls
- **Progress Indicator**: Show audio playback progress
- **Language Toggle**: Switch between Dutch/English audio
- **Speed Control**: Accessible via settings menu

#### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing Tailwind/shadcn/ui design system
- Accessible color contrasts for audio states
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear visual hierarchy for audio controls

## Technical Considerations

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full Web Speech API support
- **Safari**: Limited support, requires user gesture
- **Firefox**: Basic support, may need polyfills
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari requires specific handling

### Performance Considerations
- Audio files can be large - implement streaming/chunking
- Speech recognition can be CPU intensive
- Manage memory for audio buffers
- Optimize for mobile battery usage

### Privacy & Security
- Audio data processing happens locally (Web APIs)
- No audio storage on servers (respect user privacy)
- Clear privacy policy for voice features
- User consent for microphone access

### Error Handling
- Microphone permission denied
- Speech recognition failures
- Audio playback failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Browser compatibility fallbacks

## Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- Modern browser with Web Speech API support
- Microphone access permissions
- Audio output capabilities
- Existing OpenAI integration (unchanged)

### Design Dependencies
- Lucide React icons (already included)
- Tailwind CSS classes for animations
- shadcn/ui component patterns

### External Dependencies
```json
// New package.json additions (optional)
{
  "react-speech-kit": "^3.0.1", // Alternative speech wrapper
  "@types/web-speech-api": "^0.0.1" // TypeScript definitions
}
```

### Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality
- Cannot break current chat flow
- Must work on mobile devices
- Must be accessible to screen readers
- Should work offline where possible

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Web Speech API support varies
- **Mobile Performance**: Audio processing on mobile devices
- **Dutch Language Accuracy**: Speech recognition quality for Dutch

### Medium Risk
- **User Adoption**: Users may prefer text input
- **Audio Quality**: TTS voice quality perception
- **Development Complexity**: Integration with existing state management

### Low Risk
- **API Integration**: Existing OpenAI flow remains unchanged
- **UI/UX**: Building on established design system

### Mitigation Strategies
- Progressive enhancement (graceful degradation)
- Comprehensive browser testing
- User feedback collection and iteration
- Fallback to text input always available

## Success Criteria & Testing

### Functional Testing
- Voice recording starts/stops correctly
- Transcription accuracy meets 85% threshold
- Audio playback works across browsers
- Integration with existing correction/translation flow
- Mobile responsiveness and touch interactions

### Performance Testing
- Recording startup time < 500ms
- Audio playback latency < 1s
- Memory usage remains stable during long sessions
- Battery impact testing on mobile devices

### User Testing
- User onboarding and feature discovery
- Voice input accuracy in real scenarios
- Audio output quality perception
- Accessibility testing with assistive technologies

### Analytics Implementation
- Voice feature usage rates
- Session duration impact
- Error rates and failure modes
- User satisfaction surveys
